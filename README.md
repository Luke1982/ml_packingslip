# PackingSlip module for CoreBOS

The purpose of this module is to create a module where packinslips can be created for sales orders,
especially when sales orders are delivered partially. Planned features are

- Adding an action link to salesorders that creates a packingslip, including all the product and service lines.
- Setting a delivery date.
- Create a coreBOS updater entry that creates a workflow to notify customers a packing slip has been created, that includes the planned delivery date and products mentioned on the packing slip.
- Whatever comes to mind...
